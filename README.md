# SofyosPortableMinecraft
An easy way to make your minecraft portable by putting your files on a usb flashdrive.
## How to use:
### 1. Download this project
### 2. Put the content of the project at the root of your Minecraft usb
It should look something like this
<pre>
YourUSB (E:)/  
├─ README.md (which you can delete)  
├─ PortableMinecraft/  
│  ├─ _MyFiles/  
│  │  └─ README.txt (pls read ;-;)  
│  ├─ Instances/  
│  │  └─ README.txt (pls read this too ;-;)  
│  ├─ Launcher/ (hidden - because you don't want to launch minecraft from here..)  
│  │  └─ Minecraft.exe  
│  ├─ PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.py (hidden - but you can modify it if you know what you're doing ;) )  
└─ └─ PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.exe 
</pre>

### 3. Put a minecraft profile/instance in the Instances folder
This is what is described in the README.txt file in the Instances folder.
For example, you can create a 'MyMinecraft' folder, and copy/paste the content of your 'AppData/.minecraft' folder in it.
### 4. Launch Minecraft using the GUI
By executing 'PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.exe', you should be able to open a GUI that allows you to select which profile you wish to launch. Select the profile and click 'launch selected profile' to launch it.
### 5. Et voilà !
Please keep in mind that you will still have to login to your Minecraft (Microsoft) account to play. This is not a crack or anything like that, just a way to move your files around for convenience purposes. Enjoy ! :D
