# SofyosPortableMinecraft  
An easy way to make your minecraft portable by putting your files on a usb flashdrive.  
## How to use:  
### 1. Download this project  
If you're new to GitHub here's how to do it:  
click on the big green ```<> Code``` button above, and then click on ```Download ZIP```.  
### 2. Put the content of the project at the root of your flashdrive  
You might need to extract it first.  
It should look something like this:  
<pre>
YourDrive (E:)/  
├─ README.md (which you can delete)  
├─ PortableMinecraft/  
│  ├─ _MyFiles/  
│  │  └─ README.txt (pls read ;-;)  
│  ├─ Instances/  
│  │  └─ README.txt (pls read this too ;-;)  
│  ├─ Launcher/ (careful - you don't want to launch minecraft from here..)  
│  │  └─ Minecraft.exe  
│  ├─ PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.py (you can modify it if you know what you're doing ;) )  
└─ └─ PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.exe 
</pre>
### 3. Put a minecraft profile/instance in the Instances folder  
This is what is described in the README.txt file in the Instances folder.  
For example, you can create a folder named 'MyMinecraft', and copy/paste the content of your 'AppData/.minecraft' folder in it.  
### 4. Launch Minecraft using the GUI  
By executing 'PortableMinecraftLauncherGUI.exe', you should be able to open a GUI that allows you to select which profile you wish to launch. Select the profile and click 'launch selected profile' to launch it.  
### 5. Et voilà !  
Please keep in mind that you will still have to login to your Minecraft (Microsoft) account to play. This is not a crack or anything like that, just a way to move your files around for convenience purposes. Enjoy ! :D
